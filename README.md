I'm thrilled to share a recent data visualization journey inspired by insights from Leila Gharani. Following Leila Gharani's tutorial, I created Excel charts reminiscent of The Economist magazine. I'm excited to present screenshots from previous and improved versions for your feedback.

As a starting point, the before screenshot captured the data but left room for clarity and colour consistency improvement.
After implementing adjustments and enhancements based on storytelling with data teachings, I created an improved version. I substituted the reds with blues since reds are often associated with negative connotations, such as warnings or errors, and blues help to highlight/draw attention to a particular insight within the charts. The greys are used for neutral elements, ensuring they don't compete for attention with the highlighted insights.

I invite you all, including Leila Gharani and the storytelling with data, to share your thoughts and observations.

Thanks to Leila Gharani, storytelling with data for being a beacon of knowledge and inspiration and Yemi Akinwande for your support, which has been invaluable and has truly elevated my skills in this area. I look forward to continuing to learn from you and further honing my skills under your guidance.
